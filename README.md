# Door to Door Sales Tracker

Web application designed to allow Managers to keep track of their Salespeople and their sales.

Designed to be an in-house system. A system Admin is able to log in and view a list of existing Manager accounts, as well as create new Managers. The Admin is also able to reset a Manager's password.

Once a Manager account has been created, the Mangaer can log in and manage their list of Products they would like to sell, their list of Houses they want their Salespeople to visit, manage their Salespeople accounts (in much the same manner as the Admin manages the Manager accounts), and see a report on all Transactions their Salespeople have made.

Once a Salesperson account has been created, the Salesperson can see a list of Houses they have been assigned to and can create Sales Transactions for an assigned House.
